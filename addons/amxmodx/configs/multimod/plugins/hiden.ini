//Introduction:
//This is a Counter-Strike 1.6 mod where the hiders (Terrorists) must hide from the seekers (Counter-Terrorists) until the round ends.
//The teams will swap when the Counter-Terrorists win, or when X rounds have ended (cvar to change).
//The hiders are equipped with a broken, invisible knife (cvar), an HE grenade (cvar), two flashbangs (cvar), and a smokegrenade (cvar).
//The seekers are equipped with a knife (cvars for grenades).
//Both teams are given 100 armor (cvars per team).
//

//Removes all objectives (bombs, hostages, etc.) and doors
//Creates a fake hostage outside of the map to end the rounds.
//Removes any guns placed on the ground in special maps, such as awp_map.
//Contains two different scrim mods
//More features are described with the cvars and commands.
//
//Scrim Mods:
//Win Rounds
//This scrim mod is based upon winning and losing rounds.
//When your team is hiding, they must win X rounds in a row.
//If you lose before winning those rounds, the teams will switch and the opposite team will have a chance.
//If the teams keep switching enough times, the scrim will end.
//Point System
//This scrim mod is based upon gameplay, and earning points for how well you play.
//You can receive points for killing and winning the round.
//You can lose points for suiciding, team killing, and losing the round.
//There is a set amount of rounds to play throughout the scrim.
//After half of these rounds have passed, the teams will switch.
//After all the rounds have ended, whichever team has the most points, wins.
