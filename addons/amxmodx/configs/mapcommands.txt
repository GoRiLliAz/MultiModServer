// Format:
//   Map sections are named with '[map]' or '[map'. If the closing bracket is not set,
//      this means that not the full name was given - example: '[fy_ice' means that these
//      are executed for fy_iceworld, fy_iceworld2k_ fy_icewhatever as well.
//   Server and Client Sections are named #server, #client or #all.
//      This specifies where the commands are being executed.
//   Comments (like these (-.-) ) HAVE to be made with // at the BEGINNING of the line.
