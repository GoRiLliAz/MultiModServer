Amx_Ultra - After the great success of Amx_Super... There is Amx_Ultra


1. Why all these plugins are not too much functionality?
 * Because there is only 15 actives by default. Then you those which ones are 
good or for you, activating or deactivating then. 
Like, you want to play SuperHeros, Zombie, Dragon Ball, ...? Then active it 
by typing "amx_multimodz help 1" at console to see the command, or just type, 
"amx_votemod"  to force a mod votation, admins only of course, but players 
can still try "say votemod".
Hence, sure. You can create you own mod combining some of those, as a new 
Mod Called "Super 4 Fun Mod", containning amx_gore_ultimate, 
Ultimate Quake Sounds, etc... 
See here below at "Configuration" section how to configure it at the 
Multi-Mod_Core v5.0 which is already installed at Amx_Ultra plugin:

2. Where it come from and why? 
 * Come from Addons Multi-Mod, and did so because is much better develop 
it separated than mix everything at once. Hence too, because Addons Multi-Mod 
is another Amx Mod X setup, so its is incompatible with you own setup. That is, 
you have you own plugins installed at you own Amx Mod X and 
Addons Multi-Mod is incompatible because it will replace the yours and the 
original Amx Mod X plugins and your own server configurations files. 
So now, Amx_Ultra plugin is compatible with you own Amx Mod X and server 
configuration files.


3. For who is such Amx_Super is designed and why it is here?
 * To whoever want its functionalities, and to that Addons Multi-Mod use it. 
And its is here for those who don't want install the Addons Multi-Mod but 
still want its functionalities. And of course,


4. Why use Amx_Ultra plugin instead of Amx_Super and why it is better than?
 * Because Amx_Ultra plugin contains Amx_Super and more plugins. And it is 
better because it is based in functionality. That is, it is composed with small 
and well defined parts that realise its own function. Such approach is better 
because you can customize/personalize Amx_Super with you own taste easily. 


5. Why is better at small pieces than a big file with its 150.000 or 5.000 lines?
 * Because such thing is a nightmare, then small and well related pieces are 
better to debug, that is, find bugs, add new related functionality, improve the 
code, whatever you want to. That is why the default Amx Mod X plugins 
don't come all at once big file.


6. If it is better at small pieces, how can it be better if contains the big Amx_Super?
 * It is not the original Amx_Super, it is a modified Amx_Super 4.1 and is 
modified to correct some original exceptions/errors and better functionally.
And it is not Amx_Super 5.0.2 because there is too much 
functionality/code/exceptions/errors that I don't like at it at all. Hence, 
this modified Amx_Super 4.1 is piece of heaven for those who don't want to 
go huntings its separated plugins.
