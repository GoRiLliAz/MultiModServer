Amx_Ultra - After the great success of Amx_Super... There is Amx_Ultra


1. Why all these plugins are not too much functionality?
 * They all are here to save your trouble of going out there taking one by one 
and installing and configuring and testing. All the ones here are already installed 
and tested. Hence, this was not developed from night to day, took me years of experience
and tousands of hours testing and debuging to finally bring it here, specially to you.
And there is not too much functionality because there is only some actives by default. 
These plugins are located at "addons/amxmodx/configs/plugins/[plugins-ultra.ini](addons/amxmodx/configs/plugins-ultra.ini)". 
Then you choose which ones are good for you, activating or deactivating then. 
Like, you want to play SuperHeros, Zombie or Dragon Ball? Then active it 
by typing "amx_multimodz help 1" at console to see the command, or just type, 
"amx_votemod"  to force a mod votation, admins only command, of course, 
but players can still try "say votemod".
Hence sure, you can create you own new mod Mod as "My Super 4 Fun Mod", 
combining some of those [plugins](addons/amxmodx/configs/plugins-ultra.ini) of 
Amx_Ultra, like amx_gore_ultimate, Ultimate Quake Sounds, 
pain_shock_free, cssurfboards, bad_camper, etc... 
See at "[Multi-Mod_Core v5.0 - Configuration section](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=270188#Configuration)" 
how to configure it. 
The "Multi-Mod_Core" plugin is already integrated with Amx_Ultra.


2. Where it come from and why? 
 * Come from [Addons Multi-Mod](https://github.com/addonszz/AddonsMultiMod), 
 and did so because is much better develop it separated than mix everything at 
 once. Hence too, because Addons Multi-Mod is another Amx Mod X setup, 
 so its is incompatible with you own setup. That is, you have you own plugins 
 installed at you own Amx Mod X and Addons Multi-Mod is incompatible 
 because it will replace the yours and the original Amx Mod X plugins and 
 your own server configurations files. 
So now, Amx_Ultra is compatible with you own Amx Mod X and server 
configuration files. And it is composed with small and well defined parts that 
realise its own function. Such approach is better because you can 
customize/personalize Amx_Ultra with you own taste easily. 


3. Why is better at small pieces than a big file with its 150.000 or 5.000 lines?
 * Because such thing is a nightmare, then small and well related pieces are 
better to debug, that is, find bugs, add new related functionality, improve the 
code, whatever you want to. That is why the default Amx Mod X plugins 
don't come all at once big file.


4. For who Amx_Ultra is designed and why it is here?
 * To whoever want its functionalities, and to [Addons Multi-Mod](https://github.com/addonszz/AddonsMultiMod) use it. 
And its is here for those who don't want install the Addons Multi-Mod but 
still want its functionalities. And of course, to find the best of the best 
and don't spend time testing, configuring and debugging they.
