The Addons zz is a Addons Multi-Mod and contains numerous mods and comes 
standard configured for maximum performance and server control. 
Currently it is tested under Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike Condition Zero.

It's differential are servers adjustments create to provide a customized 
CS Server and a plugin called "multi-mod_core.sma" that in game 
(with server running) can switch between "usual game" and superheros 
1.2.0.14, predator, knife arena, ultimate warcraft mod or deactivate any 
of them. Once a mod like superheros is active, it continues active forever 
(you can reopen the server, changelevel, etc). It continues active until you
deactivate it or active some other mod like predator. And in the last five minutes 
or be asked before a vote by the command "say votemod", creates a vote to select 
what will be the Mod played in the next changelevel/restart.

If your game mode is cstrike or czero, copy the content of cstrike/czero at (Source Code Zip)

Note 1: In order to use the commandmenu (key h in game). Every server 
administrator should have the source code files (Source Code Zip) above installed, 
at his own Game Mod copy, or just the the folder "gamemod_common/admin" and
the file "gamemod_common/commandmenu.txt".
